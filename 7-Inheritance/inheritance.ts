// Inheritance is an important aspect of object oriented programming languages like C# and Java.
// Inheritance is a mechanism of acquiring the features and behaviors of a class by another class. 
// The class whose members are inherited is called the base class, and the class that inherits those 
// members is called the derived/ child class. Further, in child class you can override or modify the
//  behaviors of its parent class and also can add new one.

//  Traditional JavaScript uses functions and prototype- based inheritance but TypeScript supports 
// object- oriented class-based inheritance.Hence, in TypeScript you can extend the features and 
// behaviors of an existing class into new one through the extends keyword.

// Like C# and Java languages, TypeScript supports only single inheritance and 
// multi- level inheritance.It doesnâ€™t support multiple and hybrid inheritance.
